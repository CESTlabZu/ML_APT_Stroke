# Enhancing Amide Proton Transfer Imaging in Ischemic Stroke Using a Machine Learning Approach with Partially Synthetic data

###
This project focuses on applying a Machine Learning (ML) model trained using partially synthetic data, along with an optimization approach, for predicting amide proton transfer (APT) imaging in an animal stroke model.
